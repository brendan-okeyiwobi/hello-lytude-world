<h2><b>3. Error Message<br></b></h2>
If you uploaded a content please do not do so again in the next hour!,<br> If you uploaded a content in Okey-Iwobi MUsic Add your music, and it gives you bck this message "failed to upload, please try again." In most cases it is beacause your content is too large to be uplaoded.<br> Some times if your content is uplaoded we mights recieve it 

<p><b>3.1. Free products<br></b>
All the products and musics are said to be free. Although it is not directly free, we make the products free after, at most, seven months. This is because we do not want to make our free products to not look good quality, and also make it appear trending which forces the tend to happen, due to the modern days.<br>

 

Why it is at most seven weeks is because we sell our products at a maximum price of $30 (thirty dollars) and the price reduces by a dollar weekly from when released, when calculated, it be equals to thirty weeks which is seven months. <br>

‚Äã

Another reason for doing this is because it attracts more visitors and customers to our services because not all businesses does their product policies in this way. Besides, people will always want to get a product for free. Although there are times when we loose money due to the product not trending after we bought for a bargain. In this case the product may appear to rise price again. This method is in total a gain, because our music is and product is mostly owned by us or a person given for free with quality copyrighted contents or made a bargain, got it for ten dollars and sold for 15 dollars. So we make the product free after, at most, seven days because we want our users or customers or members or visitors to gain the same right for the product/s.  <br></p>

<p><b>5.1 Making Payments‚ö†Ô∏è<br></b>
 
<b><p>5.1.1 Paying with PayPal<br></b>
Thank you for buying a product in Okey-Iwobi Music. PayPal is an electronic commerce company that facilitates payments between parties through online transfers. PayPal allows customers to establish an account on its platform, which is connected to a user's credit card or checking account.<br>


This site is not licensed or co-oped with PayPal. Okey-Iwobi Music was created with wix.com. A free website builder. Here are the legal rights, terms of use and agreements with PayPal. Legal Agreements for PayPal Services.<br></p></p>

<p><b>5.1.2 Paying with Credit/Debit Cards<br></b>
 
There are many ways to buy a content. But Okey-Iwobi offers only two ways to keep the business transactions secure. Paying with credit/debit cards is one the ways to buy a product in Okey-Iwobi Music.<br>


If you buy a product with Okey-Iwobi Music you have the right to pay with credit/debit card but please don't try to play the game smartly just follow the instructions given to you at the moment when attempting to buy a product<br>

<p><b>5.2 Making Refunds<br></b>
 
A refund is an act of paying back (money), typically to a customer who is not satisfied with goods or services bought.<br>

 

As said in article 4, Making refunds is almost certainly not possible to make refunds after making payments. This is because this site is created with wix the leader of web building. And all the features on this website and this website itself was made possible by wix. So we are not sure if refunding is possible.<br>


We can give you a helpful tip.  If you don't want to get any attention with the refunds policy. You can buy your product using PayPal. If you don't have an account you can sign up here. we recommend this because PayPal gives you the right for refund. If you still insist of paying with your Credit/debit card, you can wait for the price to reduce till it's free and then you can buy it. If you want the item right away you can risk buying the product with the risk of no money back<br></p>
